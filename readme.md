Scarab is a BION (**B**u**i**ld Your **O**wn **Node** system) (I totally didn't butcher that)

It's main interpreter is the BehaviorInterpreter and the main Centralizer is a stat map. However, Scarab supports creation of whatever nodes you want. I don't know why this system exists.

Centralizer: Something shared between nodes
Interpreter: Something that can perform actions with regards to all centralizers and the node's context.
